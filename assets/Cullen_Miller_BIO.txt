Cullen Miller works in the substratum of aesthetics. Typified by dematerialization, his practice is often intangible or invisible and is characterized by and embodied in systems, music composition, emergence, and philosophy. His interests are expressed through open-ended, temporal models rather than encapsulated into monistic objects. His work tends to resist reductive constraints and tends to be experiential - using relationships and networks to unmask behaviors latent within his systems. By leveraging parametric and cybernetic processes his installations and performances resemble 'tuned' physics flowing through sets of rules. What emerges from the environments rarely have identical outcomes but, instead, are defined by a set of properties that generated by complex webs of feedback.

Project statement (300 characters):

Claves Angelic√¶ is a procedure for constructing, enciphering, and casting a magical Word onto the Ethereum network. After the transaction is verified it is parsed and passed into a sigil generating algorithm and an inked paper talisman is drawn by a machine as a token of their spell.


Artist Group Bio (300 characters)

Our work probes into immaterial processes leveraging computational materials as a vehicle into complexity; our aesthetics tend to be emergent unknowns retrieved from systems. Rather than constructing defined forms we use generative machine processes as a way of excavating ideas from the Outside.

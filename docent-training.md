# Claves Angelicae
### Docent Training

Claves Angelicæ is an installation and procedural system that enables a participant to inscribe a magical Word onto the Ethereum network.

The seven step process is designed to collect and transmute the participants’ input data into an encrypted message. For the participant to cast their Word they must transmit Ether (ETH) to a preselected set of charities. Once the spell has been cast and verified by the consensus pool, the transaction signature’s hash is returned, parsed, and passed into a sigil generating algorithm. The participant receives an inked paper talisman authored by a mechanical drawing machine as a tokenized sigil of their spell.

Docent must engage with the installation in the following ways:

1.  Inform the participant that they require a mobile wallet loaded with ETH to donate to one of the four charities in order to received a unique Sigil of their transaction

2.  Docent communicates with the participant when they come to the end of the experience where they donate ETH in the following ways:

    A.   If the participant does not completes the experience, the docent must reset the experience with provided interface. 

    B.   If the participant finishes the experience and chooses to donate, the docent must be present to guide them through the donation process with their mobile wallet. The docent must communicate the minimum gas requirements of the Ethereum transaction (at the time of this document, it's about 0.01 ETH for a minumum donation)

3.  As the participant sends ETH to the charity of their choice, the docent must keep others from using the installation and leave the current charity active on the screen.

4.  Docent watches the donation wallet on Etherscan.io to confirm the transaction goes through.

5.  Once the transaction completes, docent must "cast" the participants spell to the charity of choice.

6.  Docent watches the "cast" transaction to confirm it complete and verified

7.  Docent loads paper into the plotter to prepare for the Sigil render

8.  Docent starts the plot of the Sigil and gives it to the parcipant when  the plot is is complete.

9. Docent resets experience and welcomes the next guest to participate.

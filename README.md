### Project statement (short)

Claves Angelicæ is a procedure for constructing, enciphering, and casting a magical Word onto the Ethereum network. After the transaction is verified it is parsed and passed into a sigil generating algorithm and an inked paper talisman is drawn by a machine as a token of their spell.

### Artist Group Bio (short)

Our work probes into immaterial processes leveraging computational materials as a vehicle into complexity; our aesthetics tend to be emergent unknowns retrieved from systems. Rather than constructing defined forms we use generative machine processes as a way of excavating ideas from the Outside.

### Installation Rider / Requirements

- Dedicated internet connection
- Power drop (1x 120v AC)
- Folding table with 2x black chairs and black tablecloth
- Installation area with floorspace of minimum 14 sq feet

### Project statement (long)

Claves Angelicæ is an installation and procedural system that enables a participant to inscribe a magical Word onto the Ethereum network. 

The seven step process is designed to collect and transmute the participants’ input data into an encrypted message. For the participant to cast their Word they must transmit Ether to a preselected set of charities. Once the spell has been cast and veri ed by the consensus pool, the transaction signature’s hash is returned, parsed, and passed into a sigil generating algorithm. The participant receives an inked paper talisman authored by an mechanical drawing machine as a tokenized sigil of their spell.

Cryptography and magic have a deep, intertwined history dating back to the origins of writing. During the European dark ages monastic sects bore the responsibility of keeping the rites of the sacred ancient mystery cults of Egypt and Greece intact. However, in doing so they ran the risk of being burned at the stake for committing crimes of heresy. Some of them developed cryptographic systems to encode these secrets into their manuscripts. It was not only the monks working with ciphers but also natural magicians and occultists. The latter groups weren’t only using cryptography to obfuscate sensitive information, but also to devise keys and linguistic frameworks for communicating into the Ethereal realms. By devising new linguistic schemata these magicians believed that they could access the preternatural realms outside the worlds they were exploring in their scienti c pursuits. Although the blockchain space is largely secularized, the principles of the Ethereum network is a manifest dream of the ancient magi. Magicians are the original cipherpunks. Solidity, Serpent, LLL are grimoires (Latin grammaire) or books of magical grammar. Smart contracts are daemons invoked to enact our Will. DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) are archons for governing and managing resources from the Ether. Pentacles are cryptographic tokens for binding daemons and storing value. Magical codes of ethics are emblematized in protocol authorship. Salt, one of the alchemical primes, is also used in cryptography where it serves as random data that is used as an additional input to a one-way function that ‘hashes’ the Word. Sigils are graphical databases used for storing enciphered information.

For common parlance let’s define what a sigil is: the encoding of desire or intent into a symbol. The Latin sigillum, means ‘seal’, though it may also be related to the Hebrew הלוגס (segula meaning ‘word, action, or talisman’).A few examples of sigils are Johannes Trithemius’ experiments in Steganographia, Giordano Bruno’s mnemonic devices, and John Dee’s Sigillum Dei Aemaeth.

Centralized authorities and trusted-third parties (churches & banks) shape our cultures into monotheistic tendencies (e.g. "In God WeT rust") where priests or bankers arbitrate and broker access to the value system. Whereas decentralized systems allow for a plurality of deities to inhabit the Ether and entrust magicians to enact their Will without permission.

#### o. Initiation

Claves Angelicæ is a seven step process to guide one through the process of securely constructing a Word with an ‘Alphabet of Desire.’ This Alphabet of Desire is a mediation with one's own libidinal framework. Magic has many aspects, but it primarily acts as a dramatized system of psychology. It is the science and art of causing change to occur in conformity with one's Will. A magical spell is quite literally the spelling out of a Word. Once the Word is constructed within oneself it is set in motion by bringing it forth into grammar and sound. When completed one must seal it and cast it out into the Ethereum network.

#### i. Banishing
Everyone has a natural fortress within themselves: the Soul impregnable. However beyond this central citadel, one also has outerworks which are vulnerable and susceptible to violation. Banishing rites are twofold: Firstly, it provides a cleansing and maintenance of the walls of the fortress. Secondly, it operates as  firewall for the body and the space surrounding it. This allows for the secure outbound transmissions of magical Words (spells) while fortifying and consecrating the Magician in a bastion away from exploits and malicious attacks.


#### ii. Logos
“In the beginning there was theWord (Logos). ”A Word is twofold: internal and uttered. An internal Word is a conception of the mind, and motion of the soul, which is made without a voice.The Word is to be silently contemplated. The Logos is the generative principle with which impregnates potentiality. The semiotics of magic are thus: the map is not the territory. The Name is the thing itself.

#### iii. Incantation
The Word is twofold: internal and uttered. An uttered word is the internal Word brought forth through breath into vibration. Through this act of locution the Will sets the Word in motion. Incantation is derived from the Latin "incantare" meaning "to enchant, cast a spell." The infamous magical word "Abracadabra" derived from the Aramaic meaning "I create as I speak." All communication contains sorcery because humans use a variety of noises to create a semantic grid projected upon incidents and events. These grids are generally called languages. Language is the material mediation between subconscious desires and the conscious mind. And Will is encoded into language for transmission. It is by Will alone that the Word is set in motion.

#### iv. Seal
Sealing is the act of encrypting a message. This is done through the process of transmuting the Word into a graphical sigil by tracing the path on the map of the Alphabet of Desire. The map that underlies the path that the line follows is defined by the Rosy Cross and holds the majestic alphabet of the ancient magi.

#### v. Casting
Once the Word has been synthesized and prepared for secure transmission on the network it must be activated by casting it out. Once the spell is cast a smart
contract daemon is invoked to route the Word to its destination. This destination address is assigned by selecting a cardinal direction to where the Word is to be cast. After the spell is completed the Word is inscribed onto the distributed ledger of the Ethereum network.

#### vi. Sigil
The daemon listening for the cryptographically signed acknowledgement of transfer is animated to draw the Sigil onto a paper talisman with a mechanical writing machine when it can verify that the Word has been authored. The Sigil is both sign and signifier of the encrypted Word's transaction record on Ethereum's public ledger.

### Sigil Generation

Sigils are generated with a bespoke graphical encryption algorythm developed by the Artists.

1. Word or phrase is entered in by the viewer.
2. The Word or Phrase is hashed with sha256
3. Every 10th character of the hash is appended to a new string until the string is 10 chars long.
4. This 10-char string is used to trace a graphical sigil with the Alphabet of Desire, as shown below

### Experience Requirements for Attendees

In order to cast their Word or Desire to the Ethereum blockchain and complete the experience, the viewer will need to prepare and be familiar with using a mobile wallet that allows them to send an amount of Ether that at minimum covers the transaction costs of the transaction, which will vary depending on the network load.
